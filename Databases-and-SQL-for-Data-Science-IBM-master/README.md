## About this Course

Much of the world's data resides in databases. SQL (or Structured Query Language) is a powerful language which is used for communicating with and extracting data from databases. A working knowledge of databases and SQL is a must if you want to become a data scientist.

The purpose of this course is to introduce relational database concepts and help you learn and apply foundational knowledge of the SQL language. It is also intended to get you started with performing SQL access in a data science environment.  

The emphasis in this course is on hands-on and practical learning . As such, you will work with real databases, real data science tools, and real-world datasets. You will create a database instance in the cloud. Through a series of hands-on labs you will practice building and running SQL queries. You will also learn how to access databases from Jupyter notebooks using SQL and Python.

No prior knowledge of databases, SQL, Python, or programming is required.

Anyone can audit this course at no-charge. If you choose to take this course and earn the Coursera course certificate, you can also earn an IBM digital badge upon successful completion of the course.

## Syllabus

### WEEK 1

#### Getting Started with SQL

* **Key Concepts**
    * Create and execute basic SQL statements on a live database
    * Demonstrate how to write basic SQL statements
    * Describe SQL and Databases
    * Explain the syntax of basic SQL statements

#### In this module, you will be introduced to databases. You will create a database instance on the cloud. You will learn some of the basic SQL statements. You will also write and practice basic SQL hands-on on a live database.


**Graded:** Databases
**Graded:** Basic SQL

### WEEK 2

#### Introduction to Relational Databases and Tables

* **Key Concepts**
    * Compose and execute CREATE TABLE, ALTER, DROP, and TRUNCATE statements hands-on on a live database.
    * Create a database instance on the Cloud
    * Describe basic relational database concepts including tables, primary keys and foreign keys.
    * Distinguish between Data Definition Language and Data Manipulation Language.
    * Explain the syntax of the ALTER, DROP and TRUNCATE statements.
    * Explain the syntax of the CREATE TABLE statement.

#### In this module, you will explore the fundamental concepts behind databases, tables, and the relationships between them. You will then create an instance of a database, discover SQL statements that allow you to create and manipulate tables, and then practice them on your own live database.

**Graded:** Relational DB Concepts and Tables

### WEEK 3

#### Intermediate SQL

* **Key Concepts**
    * Build queries to access multiple tables
    * Demonstrate how to sort and order result sets
    * Demonstrate how to use string patterns and ranges in SQL queries
    * Demonstrate how to write sub-queries and nested selects
    * Demonstrate the use of grouping data in result sets

#### In this module, you will learn how to use string patterns and ranges to search data and how to sort and group data in result sets. You will also practice composing nested queries and execute select statements to access data from multiple tables.

**Graded:** Refining Your Results
**Graded:** Functions, Sub-Queries, Multiple Tables

### WEEK 4

#### Accessing Databases using Python

* **Key Concepts**
    * Demonstrate how to connect to a database from a Jupyter notebook
    * Demonstrate how to create tables and insert data from Python
    * Demonstrate how to perform simplified database access from Python using SQL magic
    * Demonstrate writing SQL queries and retrieve result sets from Python
    * Describe concepts related to accessing Databases using Python

#### In this module you will learn the basic concepts related to using Python to connect to databases. In a Jupyter Notebook, you will create tables, load data, query data using SQL, and analyze data using Python.

**Graded:** Database access from Python

### WEEK 5

#### Course Assignment

* **Key Concepts**
    * Demonstrate effective use of formulating SQL queries
    * Demonstrate skill in retrieving SQL query results and analyzing data
    * Demonstrate use of invoking SQL queries from Jupyter notebooks using Python

#### In this assignment, you will be working with multiple real world datasets for the city of Chicago. You will be asked questions that will help you understand the data just as you would in the real wold. You will be assessed on the correctness of your SQL queries and results.

**Graded:** Peer-graded Assignment
**Graded:** Final Exam

### WEEK 6

#### Bonus Module: Advanced SQL for Data Engineering (Honors)

* **Key Concepts**
    * Create and query view
    * Create stored procedures and invoke them from other code
    * Describe the benefits and disadvantages of using stored procedures
    * Describe the benefits that views provide
    * Describe the significance of ACID transactions
    * Explain how to use different types of JOIN operators
    * Use joins to query data from multiple tables
    * Use transactions in your SQL code

#### This module covers some advanced SQL techniques that will be useful for Data Engineers. If you are following the Data Engineering track, you must complete this module. Completion of this module is not required for those completing the Data Science or Data Analyst tracks. In this module, you will learn how to build more powerful queries with advanced SQL techniques like views, transactions, stored procedures and joins.

**Graded:** Views, Stored Procedures and Transactions
**Graded:** JOIN operations
